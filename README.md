**Your agents, by design.** Every AI coding tool your team uses ships its own configuration format, directory structure, and file conventions. Use three tools and you maintain three separate configuration trees — `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.gemini/` — that drift from each other silently. When someone updates the rules in one, the others are forgotten.

`xcaffold` gives you `.xcaf` manifests as your single source of truth — compiling deterministically into native configuration for every provider your team uses.

```
project.xcaf  ──►  xcaffold apply  ──►  claude       ──►  .claude/
                                   ──►  cursor       ──►  .cursor/
                                   ──►  gemini       ──►  .gemini/
                                   ──►  copilot      ──►  .github/
                                   ──►  antigravity  ──►  .agents/
```

This is **Harness-as-Code**: the complete agent harness — system prompts, tools, rules, memory, hooks, MCP servers, and policies — declared once in version-controlled `.xcaf` manifests, compiled deterministically, with drift detection and compile-time policy enforcement.

## Why xcaffold

- **Deterministic compilation.** The same `.xcaf` inputs always produce the same output. Compilation is a pure function — no surprises, no state.
- **Drift detection.** `xcaffold status` compares SHA-256 hashes of compiled files against the source manifests. Unauthorized manual edits are flagged immediately.
- **Fidelity reports.** When a provider cannot express a field, xcaffold emits a structured report. Configuration is never silently dropped.
- **Compile-time policy enforcement.** `kind: policy` rules gate `xcaffold apply`. A policy with `severity: error` stops compilation before anything is written to disk.
- **Provider-native output.** Cursor receives `.mdc` files with glob patterns. Copilot receives `instructions/` files with `apply-to` frontmatter. Claude receives `agents/*.md`. Each provider gets its own format — not a flattened copy.

## Quick Start

**Already have a `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, or `.gemini/` directory?** Import your existing configuration in seconds:

```bash
xcaffold import --target claude    # reads .claude/ → generates .xcaf manifests
```

**Starting from scratch:**

```bash
xcaffold init                      # scaffold a new project.xcaf
```

**Core workflow:**

```bash
xcaffold apply                     # compile .xcaf → .claude/, .cursor/, etc.
xcaffold status                    # detect drift in output directories
xcaffold validate                  # validate manifests without compiling
xcaffold graph                     # visualize resource scope and dependencies
xcaffold list                      # list all resources across providers
```

## What xcaffold Manages

Each `.xcaf` manifest declares one resource in the agent harness. xcaffold compiles the full set to the appropriate native format per provider:

| Kind | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `agent` | Identity, system prompt, model selection, tool declarations |
| `skill` | Reusable capability modules with scoped tool access |
| `rule` | Constraints and standards enforced at the provider level |
| `hooks` | Lifecycle hooks — pre/post tool use, session events |
| `mcp` | MCP server declarations and connection configuration |
| `memory` | Persistent memory definitions |
| `settings` | Provider-level permissions and behavior settings |
| `policy` | Compile-time enforcement; violations block `xcaffold apply` |
| `workflow` | Multi-step agent procedures |
| `blueprint` | Resource subset selectors for multi-environment targeting |
| `context` | Formal workspace context declarations |

## Key Features

### Variables and Overrides

Variables inject shared values into any manifest — frontmatter and body — from a single file. Change a value once, and every agent updates on the next `apply`.

`xcaf/project.vars` — committed, shared across all targets:

```
stack = TypeScript with React and Next.js
test-cmd = pnpm test
lint-cmd = pnpm lint
```

`xcaf/agents/developer/agent.xcaf` — references variables in both fields and body:

```yaml
---
kind: agent
version: "1.0"
name: developer
description: "Full-stack developer for the application."
model: ${var.model}
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep]
---
You are a senior developer working on a ${var.stack} codebase.

Run tests with: ${var.test-cmd}
Run linting with: ${var.lint-cmd}
Follow the conventions in CONTRIBUTING.md.
```

Per-target variable files override the base. `xcaf/project.claude.vars` sets `model = opus` while `xcaf/project.cursor.vars` sets `model = auto` — same agent, different model per provider.

For structural differences — different tools, different behavior — use override files. An override placed alongside the base merges at compile time:

`xcaf/agents/developer/agent.claude.xcaf` — Claude gets a more capable model and extra tools:

```yaml
---
kind: agent
version: "1.0"
model: opus
tools: [Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep, WebFetch, WebSearch]
---
```

All other providers compile the base manifest unchanged.

### Blueprints

A project with 12 agents, 30 rules, and 8 MCP servers compiles everything on every `apply`. That means every developer loads every agent — frontend rules firing for backend code, database MCP servers consuming context tokens during UI work.

A blueprint narrows the scope. Transitive dependencies (an agent's declared skills, rules, and MCP servers) are included automatically.

```yaml
kind: blueprint
version: "1.0"
name: frontend
description: "Frontend development — React components, styling, tests."
agents: [frontend-dev, designer]
rules: [react-conventions, accessibility, no-secrets]
mcp: [storybook, figma-tokens]
```

```yaml
kind: blueprint
version: "1.0"
name: backend
description: "API development — routes, database, infrastructure."
agents: [api-dev, dba]
rules: [api-conventions, sql-safety, no-secrets]
mcp: [postgres, redis]
```

```bash
xcaffold apply --blueprint frontend   # frontend dev gets only what they need
xcaffold apply --blueprint backend    # backend dev gets a different subset
```

Without `--blueprint`, `xcaffold apply` compiles everything.

### Compile-Time Policies

A `kind: policy` file declares a constraint that runs on every `xcaffold apply` and `xcaffold validate`. `severity: error` blocks output entirely — no files are written to disk.

```yaml
kind: policy
version: "1.0"
name: require-agent-description
description: "Every agent must have a description for delegation to work."
severity: error
target: agent
require:
  - field: description
    is-present: true
    min-length: 10
```

### Drift Detection and Import

`xcaffold status` checks whether compiled output files match the SHA-256 hashes recorded at the last `apply`. `xcaffold import --target <provider>` reads an existing provider directory and generates `.xcaf` manifests from it — enabling a two-way workflow.

```bash
xcaffold status                      # report drift in all output directories
xcaffold import --target cursor      # capture manual edits back into .xcaf sources
xcaffold apply                       # recompile from the updated manifests
```

*Compiled as rules + skills for providers without a native workflow format.
**Persistent context can be delivered through `context`, `rule`, or `hooks` kinds. See [memory reference](docs/reference/kinds/provider/memory.md#cross-provider-memory-patterns).

When a feature cannot be expressed in a target's native format, xcaffold emits a structured fidelity report rather than silently dropping configuration. You always know exactly what was and was not applied.

The provider architecture is open. Adding a new target requires implementing two Go interfaces (`TargetRenderer` and `ProviderImporter`). Agent SDKs with declarative configuration formats are natural expansion targets. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Use Cases

**Mixed-tool teams.** Your team uses Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex. One `project.xcaf` with `targets: [claude, cursor, codex]` compiles a consistent harness for all three. When a rule changes, one commit updates every provider.

**Migrating between tools.** Moving from Cursor to Claude Code? `xcaffold import --target cursor` captures your existing `.cursor/` setup as `.xcaf` manifests. Update `targets`, run `apply`, and your rules and agents compile to Claude's native format.

**MCP server management.** Six MCP servers across three tools means config entries that drift independently. xcaffold declares each server once in a `kind: mcp` manifest and compiles to every provider's native connection format.

**Team governance.** A `kind: policy` that requires every agent to declare a description, with `severity: error`, enforces the standard at compile time. Violations are caught in CI before any output reaches a developer's machine.
